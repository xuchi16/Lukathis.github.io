# Configurations for Github, Gradle and IntelliJ

* Step 1. Create an empty repository in Github
* Step 2. Clone the project to local
* Step 3. Open IntelliJ and select open this project
* Step 4. Select "Import project from external model"
* Step 5. Because this is a new project, so we can select "Create directories for empty content roots automatically" and choose "use gradle wrapper task for configuration" and click "Finish"
* Step 6. After gradle finish loading all the configurations. Open the Gradle tab and select "init" task.
* Step 7. If there's no corresponding src module, just right click the projeck and create a new module named 'src'. Gradle will automatically create main and test folder for us.

## Tips:
* If you want to run gradle script, please use the gradlew in your project's root folder, e.g. ./gradlew init or use brew to install gradle
